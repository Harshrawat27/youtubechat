The propaganda on all sides could have been avoided or not.","start":6212,"end":6241},{"text":" You know, plus Stalin is part of this picture. Yeah. It's like, what the fuck? What? Like you don't get characters. This is, you don't get care after the nuclear bomb. You're just not going to get characters like that. You're not going to get a global war of that kind. It might be a different one, maybe a cyber war or maybe a war in space, but we're not going to get this kind of war ever again. That was the last, the biggest than the last global war we're going to get.","start":6241,"end":6264},{"text":" So I want to be able to like mouth off and explore and yeah.

I'm not saying this is the worst thing about people who are Jew haters on Twitter.","start":6294,"end":6320},{"text":" But just from a personal perspective, I'm like, guys, you are not helping me, man.

You're like, literally, you might as well be working for Mossad. You literally make the entire you make the movement who's criticizing Israel look terrible, dude.

There's a very weird dynamic in the Israel-Palestine conflict where all of.","start":6340,"end":6363},{"text":" There's so many of the loons on both sides who almost seem like they're secretly working for the other side. Like if you see the Palestinian protests and they're chanting death to America and all this stuff, you're like, what are you what are you doing? Are you trying to make people more sympathetic to Israel? Because that's if if Rabbi Shmuley was working for Adolf Hitler or something like that, it would all make perfect sense. You're like, oh, I get it.","start":6363,"end":6392},{"text":" You sent this guy out to make everyone hate Jewish people. And then like it's just there's just a very and then with the with the Jew hating post, too. It's just yeah, it's it just feeds right into the the opposition side of how to caricature. You know, it's like, oh, so their game is they'll smear everybody who's a critic of Israel as as being a Jew hater. So your answer is to just really be a Jew hater. Like, all right. I don't think that's helping.","start":6393,"end":6420},{"text":" So maybe this is a good time to ask for your advice, because these folks are the reason why I'm hesitant.

One of the biggest regrets I have about that interview is it was only an hour. I realized that I mean, I learned a lot. But I think he's a really important historical figure.

And I've personally. So this is a bit of a therapy session, but I've personally been leaning against doing it.

But the chanting sheep of Animal Farm, Jew hating or otherwise, just make your life, they follow you around everywhere on online and make it difficult to think.

I get crowds of people who love what I do. I got a lot of people who listen to my podcast who love what I do.
